Problem
Chef considers an array good if it has no subarray of size less than NN such that the GCD of all the elements of the subarray is equal to 11.

Chef has an array AA of size NN with him. He wants to convert it into a good array by applying a specific operation.
In one operation, Chef can choose any subarray and reverse it.

Find the minimum number of operations required to convert the array into a good array and the operations themselves. If there are multiple ways to achieve the result, print any.
If it is not possible to convert the array into a good array, print -1−1 instead.

Note: A subarray of an array is formed by deletion of several (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains of single integer NN denoting the length of the array.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_NA

Output Format
If there is a way to convert the given array into a good array, then:
In a single line, output XX denoting the minimum number of operations required.
In the following XX lines, output 22 integers - LL and RR denoting the left and right index of the subarray you want to reverse. Note that, (1\le L\le R\le N)(1≤L≤R≤N).
If there is no way to convert, print -1−1 in a single line.

Explanation:
Test case 11: We need only one operation to convert the array into a good array. Choose L = 2, R = 3L=2,R=3 and reverse the subarray [2, 6][2,6] to [6, 2][6,2]. Thus, the final array is [3, 6, 2][3,6,2]. Note that in the final array, no subarray of length less than NN has gcd equal to 11.

Test case 22: It is not possible to convert the given array to a good array using any number of operations.

Test case 33: The given array is already good. That is, no subarray of length less than NN has gcd equal to 11. Thus, we need 00 operations.
